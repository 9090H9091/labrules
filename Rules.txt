## PLR RULES ###
-------------

rule doesnt only apply to only members, but yet applies to staff. If sexual content is mentioned in an accidental manner or jokeingly manner will be warned.
2. Disrespect to another person, Mentioning their culture as a whole will not lead to a ban but in disrespectful manners will lead to a mute/kick, I understand people joke around and have soft spots towards people
like their friends and i get that, But if something escalates punishment will be enforced
